# Masters Works
Included in this repository are selected final projects completed during my Masters program at Boston University. In the spirit of academic integrity, I have scrubbed the course names and identifiers from the included files so that they will not be plagiarised by future students.

### [An Analysis of Graduate Admissions](an-analysis-of-graduate-admissions)
An analysis of graduate admissions data researching whether the chance to admit can be predicted from given inputs using means-based statistical tests and Multiple Linear Regression. Includes:
   + [Data](an-analysis-of-graduate-admissions/Admission_Predict_Ver1.1.csv)
   + [RMarkdown file](an-analysis-of-graduate-admissions/An_Analysis_Of_Graduate_Admissions.Rmd) with full analysis code, and
   + [Final report](an-analysis-of-graduate-admissions/An_Analysis_Of_Graduate_Admissions.pdf)

### [Building a Data Warehouse](building-a-data-warehouse)
An end-to-end data warehousing and reporting project. Raw data and a backup of the final data warehouse can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vp_capQ94tmP5B94iq3YEFOmHCphqxRh/view?usp=drive_link). Includes:
   + [ERD](building-a-data-warehouse/Building_a_Data_Warehouse_ERD.png)
   + A [scripts](building-a-data-warehouse/Scripts) directory that contains
      + database construction queries (SQL)
      + shell scripts to automate the original data access from the [Seas Around Us](https://www.seaaroundus.org/) API, and
      + data processing scripts (as Jupyter notebooks)
   + Final report and presentation, and
   + Tableau workbook

### [An Exploration of the Effect of Feature Selection on Machine Learning](feature-selection)
An exploratory research project comparing several types of Feature Selection approaches across several Machine Learning algorithms. Includes:
   + [Data](feature-selection/data.csv)
   + [RMarkdown file](feature-selection/AnExplorationOfTheEffectOfFeatureSelectionOnMachineLearning.Rmd) with full analysis code, and
   + [Final report](feature-selection/AnExplorationOfTheEffectOfFeatureSelectionOnMachineLearning.pdf)

### [Graph Visualization Using Unstructured Text](graph-visualization-using-unstructured-text)
A demonstration of graph analysis that can support underlying NLP approaches using H.P. Lovecraft's work _The Dunwich Horror_. Includes:
   + The raw text data) as an .Robj file
   + [RMarkdown file](graph-visualization-using-unstructured-text/Graph_Visualization_Using_Unstructured_Text.Rmd) with full analysis code, and
   + [Final report](graph-visualization-using-unstructured-text/Graph_Visualization_Using_Unstructured_Text.pdf)

### [Slope One Algorithm in Spark](slope-one-algorithm-in-spark)
An implementation and example study of the Slope One algorithm in a distributed environment. The project uses large datasets from the GroupLens Project that were also used in the Netflix Prize competitions. Includes:
   + A breif [README](slope-one-algorithm-in-spark)
   + A [Jupyter notebook](slope-one-algorithm-in-spark/SlopeOneAlgorithmInSpark.ipynb) containing the full project and report, and
   + A matching [python script](slope-one-algorithm-in-spark/SlopeOne.py) with only the algorithm implementation for testing in a distributed system (eg GCP)
